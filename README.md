# Genius
*Large language model (LLM) integration for Paper Minecraft servers.*

> ⚠️ Caution
> 
> This plugin is still in **early beta** stages of development and has **not** been fully tested.
>
> Even though it doesn't interact with critical server systems (like worlds, player data, or core mechanics), beta software always carries some risk.
>
> That means:
> - Expect bugs, crashes, and unexpected behavior
> - Some features may be incomplete, broken, or subject to major changes
> - Performance is not yet optimized
>
> **Use at your own risk!**
>
> If you encounter issues, please report them on the issue tracker with as much detail as possible (logs, steps to reproduce, etc.). Your feedback helps improve the plugin!
>
> Thank you for supporting the development of Genius. 💡
